Device-RPi-GPIO version 0.01
============================

This module aims to provide a simple Perl interface to the Raspberry Pi's
GPIO pins. It is not particularly high performance (using the /sys interface)
and not particularly powerful, but it has no external dependencies and can
get the job done in many common cases.

As an alternative, you may consider using the Perl interface to the wiringPi
library. However, the bindings are currently hopelessly rusty and the Wiring
abstraction may not make much sense in Perl.

As another alternative, you may use the L<Device::BCM2835> module. However,
it also has an external dependency, requires root permissions and to actually
use it, you must study the BCM2835 chip datasheet.

INSTALLATION

DEPENDENCIES
